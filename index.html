            <h2>Dear Selene,</h2>
            <p>As this year ends, we have shared quiet moments, laughter, challenges, and growth. No matter what the year brought, having you by my side made everything brighter, and I am endlessly grateful for your love, support, and presence in my life.</p>
            <p>Although this year has been a crazy mess for the both of us, we still manage to spend some time together. Despite the various challenges that we faced, we remain strong close to each other. </p>
            <p>Pero sadyang mapag biro talaga ang tadhana, pilit tayong nilalayo sa isa't isa.</p>
            <p>We may never see each other again because of our studies, ikaw baka sa USM, tas ako depende kung dito parin sa gensan or mag iligan na. Tas yung sched pa natin baka di mag match.</p>
            <p>I didn't want to say goodbye to you as much as I wanted, but I think this is the time na. I don't want you to suffer because of me, I want to see you happy, joyful, and enjoying your life.</p>
            <p>Thank you for those moments that we shared, I appreciated your efforts and the time that you gave me. Thank you for being my light, my laughter, and my everything. I love you more than words can express.</p>
            <p>Goodbye Selene, Take care of yourself, Always be positive in life, and always do your best in everything you do. I'll always support you in whatever you do.</p>
            <p>For the last time, I LOVE YOU ðŸ˜˜. </p>
